2. What is the difference between the continue and break statements in Python?

Continue skips the code below the keyword continue and comes. Break terminates the code immediately

3. Can you explain the difference between for loop and while loop?

They have the same functionality, but for loop is used when we know the number
of executions, while we use "while" when we need to meet certain conditions, without knowing
the number of executions

How would you implement a nested for loop system? Provide an example.

for example, if I want to imitate multiplication table:

for i in range(10):
   for j in range(10):
      print(i*j)
